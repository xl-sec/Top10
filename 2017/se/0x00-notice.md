# Release

## Important Notice

### Request for Comments

This is the text version of the OWASP Top 10, and although it is useful for translators and those interested in a text version, it's not the official release, which is the PowerPoint / PDF version. 

At this stage, we are asking for

* Translations - we have some teams working already, but do reach out to us if you can help

We strongly urge for any corrections or issues to be logged at GitHub:

Through public transparency, we provide traceability and ensure that all voices are heard during this final month before publication.
